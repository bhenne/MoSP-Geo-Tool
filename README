Mobile Security & Privacy Simulator: Geo Tool

A geo data tool to modify OSM XML data for the MoSP simulator.
 * remove road network partitioning, that may harm routing
   partitions exist in the real world or may be created by
   mistakes of OSM contributors
 * simplify the road network (reduce number of nodes by generalization)
   to shrink routing information/size of routing table
 * connect POI in OSM data with the road network to enable
   a direct routing to these nodes in simulation

GUI based on GTK2 Python bindings, geo calculation on proj.4
This tool was implemented within the bachelor thesis of
Carsten Protsch at the Distributed Computing & Security Group
at the Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover, Germany. The thesis has been
advised by Benjamin Henne and Christian Szongott.
