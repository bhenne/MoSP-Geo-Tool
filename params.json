{"name":"MoSP Geo Tool","body":"### Mobile Security & Privacy Simulator Geo Tool\r\nThe Mobile Security & Privacy (MoSP) Simulation Geo Tool helps to modify and optimize spatial data from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) project for the use with the Mobile Security & Privacy Simulator.\r\n\r\nMoSP Geo Tool\r\n\r\n* shows XML-based OSM maps with map tiles in background\r\n* visualizes the different partitions of a map\r\n* connects or removes partitions of the map graph based on user parameters \r\n  (otherwise simulated people could not be routed between road network partitions)\r\n* implements basic street filters\r\n* connects selected points of interest (poi) to the road network (basic direct connection as well as intelligent connection of poi inside a building via its entrance)\r\n* calculates and applies line generalization to the map graph using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm to lower number of nodes based on user parameters\r\n\r\nGerman detailed information can be found in the corresponding bachelor thesis. Simply ask for the pdf document.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThe MoSP Geo Tool has been started as a bachelor thesis at the [Distributed Computing & Security Group](http://www.dcsec.uni-hannover.de/), Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover, Germany. The initial developer does not work on the code anymore. Feel free to contact the corresponding person (thesis advisor) @bhenne at our Group.","tagline":"Manipulate OpenStreetMap spatial data for the Mobile Security & Privacy Simulator","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
